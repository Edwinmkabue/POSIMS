# POSIMS
POSIMS is a web app that aims to support local businesses in Kenya and Africa by providing access to accounting software and services. Businesses that do not have access to these resources often struggle to efficiently conduct transactions, manage inventory, and make informed decisions based on data analysis. POSIMS aims to address these challenges by offering a platform that allows businesses to easily process transactions and track inventory from any device. Additionally, POSIMS provides business owners with valuable insights derived from the analysis of their business data, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their operations. The web app is currently in the testing phase and is built using Python, Flask, SqlAlchemy, and PostgreSQL.
